## Requirements

- On the home page (`get "/"`), users should see:
  - "99 Bottles of beer on the wall"
  - a link that says "take one down, pass it around"
  - this should link to `/98`, where the number represents the number of bottles left.
- When a number is given in the url (`get "/:number_of_bottles"`), users should see:
  - The number of bottles of beer on the wall (i.e. `98 Bottles of beer on the wall.`)
  - a link to "take one down, pass it around", where the href is number of bottles in the parameter minus 1.
- If there are 0 bottles left, do not show a link to "take one down"
  - Add a link to start over, which directs the user back to the home page.

> You may need to do some further research on Ejs to get it working! See if there's a way to create conditionals in Ejs.
